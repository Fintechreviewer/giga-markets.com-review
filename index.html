    <h1>Giga-Markets.com Review: Is Giga-Markets a Scam? ‚ö†Ô∏è</h1>
    <p><strong>Rating:</strong> ‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ (1 out of 5 stars)</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">Giga-Markets.com is a scam broker</span> that has been deceiving traders since its creation in January 2025. With no operational history, fake licenses, and false claims about fund protection, this broker is a high-risk platform that should be avoided at all costs.</p>

    <h2>üö© Why Giga-Markets is a Scam</h2>
    <h3>1. No Operational History</h3>
    <p>The Giga-Markets website was created in January 2025, which is an extremely short duration for any broker to establish trustworthiness. <span class="highlight">No reputable broker operates without a proven track record.</span></p>

    <h3>2. Fake Licenses and False Claims</h3>
    <p>Giga-Markets claims that client funds are protected and insured by the <strong>Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC)</strong> and <strong>Lloyd‚Äôs of London</strong>. However, these claims are entirely false. <span class="highlight">The broker is not licensed by any regulatory authority, including the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).</span></p>

    <h3>3. Fake Awards and Credibility Tactics</h3>
    <p>To appear legitimate, Giga-Markets displays fake awards and has pages like an "Anti-Fraud Notice" to mislead users. <span class="highlight">These are common tactics used by scam brokers to gain credibility.</span></p>

    <h3>4. High Deposit Requirements</h3>
    <p>Giga-Markets requires a minimum deposit of $250, with some account types demanding up to $50,000. They claim to offer personalized investment plans, but <span class="highlight">the truth is that the more you deposit, the more you risk losing.</span></p>
